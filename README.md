I developed this project during the nights and weekends of September/2016, after finishing the port of 
[Prince of Persia for Roku](https://github.com/lvcabral/Prince-of-Persia-Roku) as part of my studies about BrightScript 2D gamming API.

If you have a Roku or Roku TV you can install the preview channel using this link: https://my.roku.com/add/LodeRunnerPreview

There are six selectable sprite modes, the original Apple II, the Commodore 64, IBM-DOS CGA, Atari 8 bits, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System. The sound effects are from the Commodore 64 port.

The player can also select from three different versions of the game (level sets): the Classic (150 levels), Championship (50 levels) and Professional (150 levels). 
The level sets, guards AI and some assets were converted from the [Javascript Lode Runner](https://github.com/SimonHung/LodeRunner_TotalRecall) project by Simon Hung.

The version 0.11 introduced a Customel Level Editor, so the user can create up to 5 personalized maps.
